First with whether you're Atheist or Theist, then also whether you are Gnostic/Agnostic about it. This is NOT a panel discussing or endorsing any religious point of view. It's only defining and identifying religious terms and how they get misused. All religions are welcome and will not be judged. Categorized, but not judged.
